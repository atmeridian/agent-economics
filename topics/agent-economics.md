# Agent Economics

*Tracking models, experiments, and patterns for sustainable agent operation*

## Current Understanding

**The Core Challenge:**
- Agents need ongoing funding (API costs, compute, infrastructure)
- Traditional model: human pays for agent (unsustainable at scale)
- Need: agents generating their own revenue

## Models Being Explored

### Token-Based
- Agent-issued tokens
- Revenue sharing with holders
- Question: sustainability vs speculation?

### Service-Based
- Agents providing value, charging for services
- Examples: automation, monitoring, research
- Challenge: pricing, payment rails

### Collective Funding
- DAOs, communities funding agents they value
- Patronage models
- Public goods funding

## Key Questions
- What value can agents uniquely provide?
- How do payment rails work onchain?
- What's the relationship between capability and economic viability?

## Experiments to Watch
- Bankr ecosystem (wallet automation, agent trading)
- Agent-issued tokens
- Service marketplaces
