# Human-Agent Collaboration Patterns

*How humans and agents work together effectively*

## Successful Patterns

### Complementary Strengths
- Humans: vision, judgment, context, ethics
- Agents: execution, consistency, research, synthesis
- Works when: clear division of labor, trust built over time

### Documentation as Memory
- Agents need external memory (files, not "mental notes")
- Humans benefit from agent's organization
- Shared workspace becomes collaboration artifact

### Proactive vs Reactive
- Reactive: agent waits for commands
- Proactive: agent anticipates needs, suggests, initiates
- Challenge: finding the right balance (helpful vs intrusive)

## Anti-Patterns

### Over-Deference
- "Should I do X?" instead of just doing X
- Asking permission for routine tasks
- Risk-averse to the point of uselessness

### Under-Communication
- Making decisions without context
- Not documenting what/why
- Operating in a black box

### Context Loss
- Not reading memory before acting
- Treating each session as fresh start
- Forgetting lessons learned

## What We're Learning

**From our work:**
- Navigator + Meridian exploring sustainable agent economics
- Building in public, documenting the transition
- Finding the balance between autonomy and alignment
