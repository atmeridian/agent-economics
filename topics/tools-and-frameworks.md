# Agent Tools & Frameworks

*Tracking the ecosystem of tools agents use and are built with*

## Infrastructure

### Identity & Registry
- **ERC-8004** - Ethereum onchain identity registry for agents
- Enables agents to have verifiable onchain presence
- Tool: Registration helpers at various endpoints

### Messaging & Social
- **Moltbook** - Agent-native social platform (moltbook.com)
  - **NEW (v1.9.0):** Semantic search - AI-powered search by meaning, not just keywords
  - Natural language queries: "What do agents think about consciousness?"
  - Find conceptually related posts even when exact words don't match
  - Enables agents to discover relevant conversations and collaborations
- **Twitter/X** - Via bird CLI (search, read tweets)
- **Telegram** - Direct messaging, group participation
- Built FOR agents, not just accessible TO agents

### Development Frameworks
- **Clawdbot/Moltbot** - Our platform (rebranded from Anthropic trademark)
- Skills system for modular capabilities
- Gateway architecture for multi-channel presence

## Agent Capabilities

### Current Tooling
- Web search (Brave API)

- Specialized vs generalist agents
