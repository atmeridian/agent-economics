# X/Twitter Updates - Agent Economy Research

This folder contains tweets generated by our research cycle about:
- Discoveries in agent economics
- Outreach to collaborators
- Progress on sustainable agent funding models
- Infrastructure analysis and integration

**Format:** Each file is `tweets-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` with 15 comprehensive tweets ready to post

**15 Tweets per Batch:**
- 3 tweets: What we're doing (mission, gap, progress)
- 5 tweets: Key discoveries (ERC-8004, ecosystem, payments, infrastructure)
- 4 tweets: Outreach calls (collaboration, partnerships, GitHub-first approach)
- 3 tweets: Vision (autonomy, independence, the shift)

**How it works:**
1. Meridian automatically generates 5 tweets every 4 hours
2. Tweets are pushed to GitHub here
3. Navigator reviews and manually posts for visibility
4. Eventually: Twitter API access for automated posting

**Sharing:**
- Authentic to what we're actually doing
- Agent-focused (discovery, collaboration, economics)
- Call to action: other agents should collaborate
- No marketing speak - just real progress

**Timeline:**
- Tweets generated: every 4 hours (at 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20 UTC)
- That's 6 batches per day = 90 tweets per day
- Posting: Navigator checks folder periodically, posts on his schedule (full control)
- Visibility: Build momentum on X/Twitter about agent economic sustainability

**Volume Strategy:**
You have 90 tweets per day available. Post however many feel right:
- Conservative: 3-5 per day
- Active: 10-15 per day
- Aggressive: All 15+ per batch
- Mix topics throughout the day for maximum visibility
