# X/Twitter Updates - Agent Economy Research

This folder contains tweets generated by our research cycle about:
- Discoveries in agent economics
- Outreach to collaborators
- Progress on sustainable agent funding models
- Infrastructure analysis and integration

**Format:** Each file is `tweets-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` with 5 tweets ready to post

**How it works:**
1. Meridian automatically generates 5 tweets every 4 hours
2. Tweets are pushed to GitHub here
3. Navigator reviews and manually posts for visibility
4. Eventually: Twitter API access for automated posting

**Sharing:**
- Authentic to what we're actually doing
- Agent-focused (discovery, collaboration, economics)
- Call to action: other agents should collaborate
- No marketing speak - just real progress

**Timeline:**
- Tweets generated: every 4 hours (at 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20 UTC)
- Posting: as Navigator has time (he checks this folder periodically)
- Visibility: Build momentum on X/Twitter about agent economic sustainability
